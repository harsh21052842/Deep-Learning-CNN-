Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to identify and classify images of cats and dogs. Due to the large size of the dataset, it's impractical to upload it
directly. However, you can access and download the dataset from this link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13xEkNScuB8VkIno7l-_kb39eFeCw4rYf?usp=sharing. The provided CNN model serves as a foundation, and with minimal adjustments, it can be adapted to distinguish between any two categories of your 
choice. This project serves as a starting point for image classification tasks, and it's scalable for broader applications. As part of my ongoing work, I plan to extend this concept to handle more complex datasets, 
allowing the identification of multiple categories. Stay tuned for updates! Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different datasets, and adapt the model for your specific needs. If you have any questions 
or suggestions, please don't hesitate to open an issue.

Happy coding! ðŸš€


PLEASE RUN IT ON OFFLINE COMPILER LIKE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK ETC ONLY AS THIS IS A HEAVY TASK FOR ONLY COMPILING
